realignfrags
	1.0	first "release". Will not compile with updated Atf_IO
	1.1 some cosmetic and readability changes. Works with generic Atf_IO
		both 1.0 and 1.1 do alignment only down to single step. No submks alignment
	
	2.0 rewamped version, does above search followed by sub-step realignment
		sub-step is done by fitting Boltzman's to the epsiodes (seems to fit hardware responce nicely)
		and then moving stuff around
	2.1 added -v and -k parameters, to limit what episodes get written out based
		on how well their fit was. Added -y to fit to smoothed curves (realign 
		original data)
	2.2 Added -u parameter, to specify individul boundaries for the fit part (maxDiff
		search is then done on wider area)
		+ some parameter consistency checks
	starting 3.0 series - will do template search as 1st step instead of simple max diff
