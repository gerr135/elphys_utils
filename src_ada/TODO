1. algorithmic:
	add least chi2,
	combine in 2-step alg: maxder -> min chi2
	smoothed template fitting
2. bindings
	gsl bindings


Programs:
realignfrags
	if direction is given, more checks for divergence  -  done
	check what's skipped if omitting maxDiff part      - checked, all is already done
	add template search:
		use sliding boltzman, seek max fit
		inputs: seeked amplitude (fixed), dx is taken default or from seedign option
