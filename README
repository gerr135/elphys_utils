This is a collection of really old code of mine for processing electrophysiological data.
This is a really specific code, and I did not touch it ever since I got some old work done
and published. Right now it would likely require a bit of effort to even get it off the
ground and compile properly. So, bug me if you think you can use this functionality, I'll
try to get to it (or, in case I need this again). Storing this on github as potentially
useful code that I might get back to..

This project consists of 3 parts, all separated under sbdirs:
src_ada:  the principal part of it.
  This contains Ada code that was used in processing the data at the time. Requires
  cleanup and rearrangement.

src_c: few utils to get raw (binary) data out and do some basic calciulations on it.
Older   than Ada code.

atf_py: some common utils to work with ATF files in python.
  ATF - Axon Text File format - the text representation of the raw data. Simpler to work
  with, but takes ~10x space. At that time (when I was a Caltech PhD student, past
  millenium), the HDD space and RAM were rather limited, so processing 1G+ (original raw,
  which would make it 10G+ in text) files was pretty much out of the question. These were
  useful for smaller fragments of the data or some integral statistics.


To build simply run make.

Requirements:
1. Ada enabled gcc or some version of gnat.

2. Installed abf_io component (you should have got it at the same place as this one)
and abf_io.gpr symlink pointing to abf_io.gpr in that component's dir.
