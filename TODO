1. Fix abf output (so that the lib can read it, worry about axon later) - done, even Axon opens, but only data..
2. find_peaks
	reads abf, atf or text (t-rows ',' separated)  -- abf only - need the waveform
	finds peaks in selected region
2.1		direct, q-pline smoothed -- ditched splines - not much difference from raw
2.2		fit with some function   -- fits expanded: parabola-baseline; model (very sensitive to seeds)

3. sort out leak subtraction  -- done, as much as possible - not much can be done about screwy data..

4. Fits:
	4.1 parabolic - immediate baseline
	4.2 model ( A*(1 - exp((-t/tm)^P)) * (h - (h-1)*exp(-t/th)) )

5. leaksub: provide option to force 0 tails? (for the bad data that cannot be helped?) -- instead added few more opts, such as to calc averages over prepulse pad

6. leaksub: add gaussian filtering at set freq (default to sampling/10 - assuming 5x oversampling) before everything
	(to smooth out controls - too much error for dV correction)

7. leaksub: lowpass filter control step heavily..
	- only usefull for subtraction and only after C-spikes settled..
	(so not much use in the region of interest)

8. leaksub: drop slow inactivation tails and calculate dV and other params from step tails..
